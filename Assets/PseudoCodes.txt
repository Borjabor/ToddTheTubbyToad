Scale:

Detect down, and call a script that alters the weight;
Scale would have a weight threshold, where it would activate
The objects and boxes would, themselves, add to the total weight

Moving Grapple Point:

detect to what is attaching, and modify it accordingly
Perhaps turn itself into child if it is supposed to move
