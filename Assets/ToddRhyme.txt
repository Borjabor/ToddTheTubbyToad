gather round, gather round
while I tell you tale quite odd
'bout a little tubby toad named todd

he lived in a pretty meadow
but was quite the anxious fellow
sad he was toad who couldn't jump

but he heard of quite a tale
of a wizard tower he could scale
and have his deepest wishes become true

so he set off on a quest
searching far and wide
for the wizard tower and put its powers to the test

it took time and perseverence
todd's adventure was quite a plight
but one day he upon a wondrous sight

his hope was renewed
his energies revitalized
he found the tower! What a boost to his mood

but he has no time to basque
now he has a whole new task
to get inside the tower and to the top

now his journey is also yours
dear player, todd is you!
so go through the tower's backdoors
fun shenanigan's will ensue
