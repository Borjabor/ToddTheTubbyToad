Moving Grapple Point:

detect to what is attaching, and modify it accordingly
Perhaps turn itself into child if it is supposed to move

A prediction of where the platform will be in 1sec might be doable; could be our solution (also see if this can be more easily modifiable, by detecting the tongue draw speed

Vine:

Already working, just by turning chains into "Object" tag. 
Improve - 
		void WithForeachLoop()
			{
				foreach (Transform child in transform)
					print("Foreach loop: " + child);
			}
			
		works to get all the children. Use this to make it versatile, probably automatically creating the connections and possibly already organizing the chain, so designers can just go crazy and duplicate stuff
		
		
Fixes


Moveable attach - offset not working properly all the time
Light Sphere - for now, working by basically making whole level/scene a danger zone after you get within it's radius once
