# ToddTheTubbyToad

This simple puzzle-platformer is a physics based game made in Unity as part of a rapid prototyping class in a larger Game Development course.

You can play the game here: https://edu-cavalcante.itch.io/todd-the-tubby-toad

I made simple tweaks to the grappling hook mechanics, like allowing the player to change height while grappling, but credit goes to 1 Minute Unity YouTube channel for the bulk of that code (https://www.youtube.com/@1minuteunity759).
