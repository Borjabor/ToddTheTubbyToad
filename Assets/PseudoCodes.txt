Scale:

Detect down, and call a script that alters the weight;
Scale would have a weight threshold, where it would activate
The objects and boxes would, themselves, add to the total weight

Moving Grapple Point:

detect to what is attaching, and modify it accordingly
Perhaps turn itself into child if it is supposed to move

Vine:

Already working, just by turning chains into "Object" tag. 
Improve - 
		void WithForeachLoop()
			{
				foreach (Transform child in transform)
					print("Foreach loop: " + child);
			}
			
		works to get all the children. Use this to make it versatile, probably automatically creating the connections and possibly already organizing the chain, so designers can just go crazy and duplicate stuff
