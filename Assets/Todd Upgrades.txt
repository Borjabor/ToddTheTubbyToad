Todd the Tubby Toad improvements:

- Opening cutscene to estabilish a story
	- Todd arrives at the candy factory as a regular frog; it's closed, so he is free to eat as much candy as he wants; after that, he gets too fat and can't walk anymore; he has to use his tongue to move around, but is unable to fit through where he came in; he has to find another way to leave the factory, and goes down an air vent; that's when the game starts

- Functioning main menu, with load, new game, and settings
	- Autosaves only; pause menus with load game/last checkpoint
	
- Create an audio system in the game, to separate music and SFX, so the player can modify the volumes independantly

- Custom tilemaps for the environments

- Update "rope" to more resemble the worms one

-Hold object toggle instead of holding button

- Cloud save? (TaroDev video)

-GameStates (can pause work with stopping all physics then resuming them?)
