Todd the Tubby Toad improvements:

- Opening cutscene to estabilish a story

- Implement Articy
 
- Functioning main menu, with load, new game, and settings
	- Autosaves only; pause menus with load game/last checkpoint
	
- Create an audio system in the game, to separate music and SFX, so the player can modify the volumes independently

- Update "rope" to more resemble the worms one (wrap around objects)

- Cloud save? (TaroDev video)

- GameStates (can pause work with stopping all physics then resuming them?)

- Overworld and level select
